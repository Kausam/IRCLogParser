Social networking involve the usage of different types of graphs for carrying out investigation and deriving results.
Different scenarios call for different graph layouts that possess the ability to visualize and understand networks as per our requirements. For e.g.
a graph plotted for community detection may require a different layout compared to a graph plotted for analyzing a user's personal traits. 
Separate layouts are made to suit specific purposes in the study of social network interactions.
python-igraphs library provides us with various graph layout algorithms. Refer to - http://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html
Layouts Info directory in this repository consists of images of a graph drawn using different python-igraphs layout algorithms.
We can see that although these layout algorithms are effective, they fail to provide us with clean, aesthetically-pleasing and comprehensible graphs.
This is where Gephi comes to the rescue. Gephi is a graph visualization and manipulation software. The layouts provided by Gephi are way more clear and intelligible. It also functionalities
for setting various properties within a layout, set a scale factor, run dynamic layouts etc. Graphs can also be analyzed and studies using Gephi to
obtain significant results. However, unlike python-igraphs which requires a graph object (generated using igraphs itself), Gephi accepts a particular graph format
for plotting graphs with different layouts. This format can be - GEXF, CSV, GraphML, GDF, Spreadsheet, Pajek, GraphViz amongst many other formats.
Gephi's acceptance of Pajek makes our life easier as we can simply generate the Pajek format of a graph object using igraphs and import it into Gephi.

Below we can see the difference between the graph layouts plotted using Gephi and python-igraphs. The distinction is remarkable!
